## Configuration

The main configuration is handled via the Streamlit UI. However, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the app by modifying `app.py`.

## File Overview

### `app.py`
The main Streamlit application file that:
- Defines the UI components and layout.
- Collects user inputs for the brand name, tagline, and product description.
- Provides options to customize the number of ad generations, output length, and creativity level.
- Calls the ad generation logic from `fine_tuned.py`.
- Optionally calls the image generation function from `dalle.py`.

### `fine_tuned.py`
Contains the logic for generating ad text using the OpenAI API:
- Defines the `AdGenerator_logic` function that takes user inputs and generates ad text based on a fine-tuned GPT-3 model.
- Uses the OpenAI API to create text completions.

### `dalle.py`
Handles image generation using the DALL-E API:
- Defines the `create_and_show_images` function that generates and displays images based on the ad text.
- Uses the OpenAI API to create images.
